Building Chirp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you'll need to download and install Git_.  Once you have Git installed,
make sure that the ``git`` command is available from the command line.  If not,
you'll need to add it to your ``PATH`` environment variable.

Next, you'll need to download and install Go_.  Once it's installed, you'll
need to create a workspace and set your ``GOPATH`` environment variable to your
workspace folder.  The Go documentation contains a great page explaining the
details on setting up your workspace titled, `How to Write Go Code`_.  There is
also a nice `screencast`_ available as well.

Once you've setup your workspace, open up a command line to your workspace
folder and run the following::

    go get github.com/yak-labs/chirp-lang
    cd src/github.com/yak-labs/chirp-lang/chirp
    go install

This will fetch the Chirp source code, ensure you're on the ``master`` branch,
and build the command line executable to run Chirp code.  If you've added ``GOPATH/bin`` to your ``PATH``, you should now be able to run ``chrip`` from your command line.
